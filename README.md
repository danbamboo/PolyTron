# PolyTron
C++ Project using polymorphism/virtual classes/inheritance/composition

There are dark times in the world of Polytron,
where battles are fought every day between Goblins, Barbarians, Reptile People,
Blue Men, and a create known as The Shadow. (added drama: We must see
through the outcomes of these attack so we as humans can prepare are own
defense.) Each of these creatures has their own individual attacks, defense
methods, level of Armor, and Strength Points. Each creature will be able to battle both one from its own race, or another from the four different races.
